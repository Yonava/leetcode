# Container With Most Water

You are given an array of positive integers where each integer represents the height of a vertical line on a chart. Find two lines which together with the x-axis forms a container that would hold the greatest amount of water. Return the area of water it would hold.

For example, given the array `[7, 1, 2, 3, 9]`, your function should return 28.

Given the array `[1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]`, your function should return 49.
