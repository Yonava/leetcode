# Islands and Treasure
You are given a `m Ã— n`2D grid initialized with these three possible values:

- -1 - A water cell that can not be traversed.
- 0 - A treasure chest.
- INF - A land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF.

Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. If a land cell cannot reach a treasure chest than the value should remain INF.

Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [
  [2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],
  [2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],
  [2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],
  [0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]
]

Output: [
  [3,-1,0,1],
  [2,2,1,-1],
  [1,-1,2,-1],
  [0,-1,3,4]
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [
  [0,-1],
  [2147483647,2147483647]
]

Output: [
  [0,-1],
  [1,2]
]
```
Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- grid[i][j] is one of {-1, 0, 2147483647}
